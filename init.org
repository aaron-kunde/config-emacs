* Custom set configurations
Variables or faces can be set by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Customization.html][Emacs Customize interface]]. Customisation shall be set explicitly in this file. Therefore, the following code blocks should always be empty:
#+begin_example emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables
   ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
   )
  (custom-set-faces
   ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
   )
#+end_example

* Startup behaviour
Disable splash screen at startup:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
#+end_src
