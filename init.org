* Custom set configurations
Variables or faces can be set by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Customization.html][Emacs Customize interface]]. Customisation shall be set explicitly in this file. Therefore, the following code blocks should always be empty:
#+begin_example emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables
   ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
   )
  (custom-set-faces
   ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
   )
#+end_example

* Startup behaviour
Disable splash screen at startup:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
#+end_src

* General functionalities
Disable annoying sounds, like when hitting TAB and no completion can be found:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
#+end_src

Disable tool bar:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

Enable to show the current column number in the mode line:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq column-number-mode t)
#+end_src

Based on the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LineNumbers][Emacs Wiki]], enable display of line numbers in the buffer for programming modes:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'display-line-numbers-mode)
#+end_src

Enable displaying of file sizes in the mode line:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq size-indication-mode t)
#+end_src

* General appearance
Themes are not used. Only adjustments to the standard faces are made.

** Customise default face
Just revert foreground and background colour:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set-face-background 'default "black")
  (set-face-foreground 'default "white")
#+end_src

** Customise cursor face
Make the cursor green:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set-face-background 'cursor "green")
#+end_src
